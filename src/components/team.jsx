                  This guy has been a Degen right from the early days of BTC. He was even renamed as Satoshi Nakamoto at a 
                  point in his Degen journey. Loves coding to a fault and migrated to web3 development early in his sojourn 
                  through this space.

                  We honestly don't know what this lady says all the time. Even when she is speaking English, we literally 
                  have to act like we understand what she is saying. But we donâ€™t understand shit except she writes it. Jokes 
                  apart, Elena was gifted with artistry at birth. This collection and many to come are all illustrated by her. 
                  Elena also leads a massive 3D game development hub.

                  Frankly, We are excited to have this guy in the team. He is a real degen and NFT/BTC/ETH OG. Along with 
                  other members of the team, he has traveled the globe promoting cryptocurrency projects and forming alliances 
                  with blockchain ecosystem developers. Mena is also an astute marketer and can sell water to a well.
